## What's this

This is a Jetpack Compose Multiplatform project template that quickly generates Android, iOS, and Desktop (JVM).

The cross-platform capability of Jetpack Compose provides Android developers with the possibility to deploy applications to multiple platforms.

This template is modified from the official [compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template),
it improves project structure and supports cross-platform capabilities on the desktop (JVM).

## Get Started

Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub to use this template.

After successfully creating a new repository, use the `git clone` command to clone your project locally, do not open the project immediately at this time.

In the root directory of the project, you can find two files, `initializer.json` and `initializer.py`, please open the `initializer.json` file, the contents are as follows.

```json
{
   // Your project name, this will be used as the name of the entire Gradle project, only English is allowed
   "__PROJECT_NAME__": "compose-multiplatform-demo",
   // Your app name
   "__APP_NAME__": "Compose Multiplatform Demo",
   // Your project group name (Package Name for Android, Group for Java, Bundle ID for iOS)
   "__GROUP_NAME__": "com.highcapable.composemultiplatformdemo"
}
```

After editing the configuration file, run the `initializer.py` script to initialize the project, after successful initialization, these two files will be automatically deleted.

If there is no Python in your system, please go to [official website](https://www.python.org/) to download one, and then execute `python3 initializer.py` on the command line.

If you are using macOS or Linux, you can execute `./initializer.py` directly.

After the project is initialized successfully, you can use Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA to open the project and ensure that you have correctly installed [kotlin-multiplatform-mobile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile) plugin.

To compile the iOS project normally, you need to use macOS for development and install Xcode.
